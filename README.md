This repository contains a collection of projects developed in Jupyter Notebooks, covering data analysis, predictive modeling, unsupervised learning, and geospatial data exploration. Below is a detailed description of each project group:

1. Cabify - Geospatial Data Analysis (Cabify_Unifinished.ipynb)
     This project focuses on geospatial data related to routes and urban mobility patterns. This project focuses on predicting whether two routes are the same or different using machine learning algorithms.
      It involves geospatial data processing, feature engineering, and supervised learning techniques to classify routes based on their characteristics.
      The goal is to improve route optimization and identify patterns in urban mobility.

2. Lead Scoring (LeadScoring_***)
      A series of notebooks covering the complete lifecycle of a Lead Scoring project:

      Data Transformation: Preparing and cleaning datasets for modeling.
      Modeling: Implementation of supervised models (classification) and unsupervised models (clustering with K-Means).
      Production: Preparation and automation of pipelines for integration into production environments.
      Key Examples:
      
      LeadScoring_05_Modelización para No Supervisado: Clustering for lead segmentation.
      LeadScoring_07_Modelización para Clasificación: Supervised classification to predict lead conversion.


3. Stolen Motorcycles Analysis (MarioPeñas_MotosRobadas_Mapit.ipynb)
      Exploratory data analysis focused on identifying patterns related to stolen motorcycles. Includes data cleaning techniques and visualizations to highlight critical areas and temporal trends.

4. Premier League - Sports Data Analysis (Premier league.ipynb)
      Not finished
      Explores and analyzes data from English football, with metrics on team performance, player statistics, and historical trends.

5. Retail Forecasting and Data Quality (Retail_***)
      A collection of projects focusing on the retail industry:

      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Retail_03_EDA.ipynb.
      Modeling: Sales predictions using regression and time series models.
      Data Quality: Evaluating and improving data quality to minimize errors in analysis.
      Key Example:
      
      Retail_06_Modelización para Regresión: Predicting future sales based on business variables.
6. Risk Scoring (RiskScoring_***)
      An advanced project centered on credit risk assessment:

      EDA: Exploring key risk factors.
      Modeling: Implementation of models for:
      Probability of Default (PD): Supervised classification.
      Exposure at Default (EAD): Regression to estimate amounts at risk.
      Loss Given Default (LGD): Regression to predict expected losses.
      Automation: Creation of pipelines for production deployment.

   
7. Unsupervised Learning (Unsupervised_prueba_oferta_trabajo.ipynb)
      A project showcasing the use of unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, applied to a practical case study related to a job offer.
